The organizing committee is delighted to invite you to submit your work for presentation at the 8th ACM conference on Information Centric Networking (ICN 2021), to be held virtually 22-24 September 2021.

ACM ICN 2021 is a single-track conference focusing on significant research contributions to ICN as broadly defined, and featuring paper presentations, posters, and demonstrations.

ICN deals with all aspects of an information- or data-centric approach toward supporting networked applications. Such an approach treats digital objects (i.e., collections of bits) as first-class objects, and supports identification, creation, retrieval, authentication, and access control for such objects through a global service.

ACM ICN 2021 solicits research contributions across the full spectrum of technologies and architectures related to ICN, including work that advances core ICN concepts, architectures, technologies, and capabilities; extends current ICN concepts to new networking environments and use cases; realizes, demonstrates, and quantifies the benefits of ICN in traditional and emerging application domains; and catalyzes, incentivizes, simplifies, and supports ICN deployments in realistic, operational environments and settings.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Vision papers identifying and scoping future research directions for ICN (limited to short papers). Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “Vision:” in the title.
- Systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge. Suitable papers are those that provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major ICN research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence, or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate and may be rejected without full review. Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title. 
- Design and implementation of global and local information-centric approaches, such as named-data, publish-subscribe, and distribution-oriented systems, including domain-specific designs
Namespace management approaches, case studies, and empirical evaluation campaigns
Security including identity bootstrapping, confidentiality and access control, authentication, and non-repudiation, as well as infrastructure resilience
- Privacy of consumers and producers of content objects
- Routing, forwarding, and caching for ICN
- Policing, QoS, multimedia transport, and adaptive network functions in ICN
- ICN solutions supporting mobile or constrained environments including 5G and network slicing, vehicular networking, autonomous driving, and machine-to-machine communication
- ICN platforms allowing specification of computations on data, and orchestration of such computations, including named computing functions at the network edge
- ICN solutions for integrating big data platforms and machine learning frameworks
- Virtualization, operation, and orchestration of named network resources including forwarding, storage, computation, and the distributed Web
- ICN network management, e.g., monitoring and fault diagnosis
- Software design and architectures to support ICN including testing and verification
- Experiences with application of information-centric networking and computation in various domains such as Internet-of-things,. edge computing, and social media.
- Measurement and analysis of ICN protocols, applications, and infrastructure 
- ICN implementation approaches based on software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), or other emerging technologies
- Implementation challenges and experiences: line speed caching, routing scalability, congestion control, network management at scale, zeroconf bootstrapping and operation
- Approaches to coexistence/evolution of information-centric and host-centric networking, including IP-based protocols in support of information-centric operations
- Incentives, money flow, and other socio technical aspects of information-centric networking

## Submission Details

The conference solicits both full and short papers. Submissions will be reviewed through a **double-blind** process, and evaluated on the basis of intellectual merit, originality, importance of contribution to the field, soundness and strength of evaluation (for full papers), quality and clarity of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work.

Full papers may be up to 10 pages in length, excluding references, following the [ACM SIGCOMM](https://github.com/conference-websites/acmart-sigproc-template/) format (10pt font, `sigconf` option for `acmart` style), and should convey the results of mature research. Short papers may be up to 6 pages in length, excluding references.

Short papers should illustrate important challenges or promising new lines of research in the realm of ICN, either through the presentation of illuminating early research results or through the vehicle of a well-reasoned and thought-provoking position statement; vision papers must be submitted as short papers. Short papers will be evaluated primarily on their ability to contribute to the future evolution of ICN research in light of the goals described above.

## Submission Instructions

Register and submit your paper by the deadline in the [conference submission site (HotCRP)](https://icn21.hotcrp.com/paper/new).

If your paper is accepted, we will provide further information for the camera-ready version.

If you have any questions about submitting papers to ICN 2021, or encounter problems with the paper submission site, contact the TPC chairs before the deadline.

## Submission Compliance

Papers submitted for consideration must not have been already published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the consideration period. Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the [ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy) and the [ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/sim_submissions).

Like other conferences and journals, ICN prohibits violation of the above ACM Policies and may take action against authors who violate them. In some cases, the program committee may share information about submitted papers with other conference chairs and journal editors to ensure the compliance of papers under consideration. If the TPC discovers a violation of these principles, sanctions may include, but are not limited to, contacting the institutions of the authors and publicizing the details of the case.

ICN will review extended versions of previously-published short preliminary papers (such as workshop papers) in accordance with published [ACM SIGCOMM](http://www.sigcomm.org/about/policies/frequently-asked-questions-faq/) policies. Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement requests will not be considered.

## Paper Anonymity

All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through **double-blind** reviewing, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you are required to make a good-faith effort to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing the reader to fully grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Common sense and careful writing will go a long way towards preserving anonymity. Minimally, please take the following steps when preparing your submission:

1. Remove the names and affiliations of authors from the title page.

2. Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources.

3. Use care in naming your files. Source file names (e.g., “Alice-n-Bob.dvi”) are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments.

4. Check the “Properties” (metadata) embedded in the file, and remove any identifying information before submitting.

5. Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work by another author.

6. Work that extends an author’s previous workshop paper is welcome, but the paper should (a) acknowledge their own previous workshop publications with an anonymous citation and (b) carefully explain the differences between the ACM ICN’21 submission and the prior workshop paper.


## Conflicts of Interest

Both authors and TPC members must identify conflicts of interest according to the following general principles.

A program committee member (including the chairs of the committee) is considered to have a conflict of interest on a submission that has an author in any of the following categories: the person himself or herself; a past or current student or academic advisor; a supervisor or employee in the same line of authority within the past four years; a member of the same organization (e.g., company, university, government agency, etc.) within the past four years or in the near future (six months); a co-author of a paper appearing in publication within the past four years; someone with whom there has been a financial relationship (e.g., grants, contracts, consultancies, equity investments, stock options, etc.) within the past four years; someone with whom acceptance or rejection would further the personal goals of the reviewer (e.g., a competitor); a member of the same family or anyone considered a close personal friend; or someone about whom, for whatever reason, their work cannot be evaluated objectively. If there is no basis for the TPC conflicts provided by authors, however, those conflicts will be removed. Do not improperly indicate conflicts simply to prevent some TPC members from reviewing your paper.
