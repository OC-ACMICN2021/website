### Video Length and Format

- The duration of any paper presentation video is 15 minutes.

- **Tool:** ACM ICN 2021 will not recommend a specific video capture tool.  Presenters can use various video conferencing tools or dedicated video recording software.

- **Video Resolution:** the preferred resolution is 1080p/HD if possible but 720P is also acceptable.  We do not require a specific bitrate, but we expect videos be of good quality (3000-10,000kb/s rate is good).  Depending on the software you are using to record/edit the video, file size can vary, 150 MB - 1.5 GB per 15-minute presentation is good.

- **Presenter’s headshot:** the presentation should show slide contents in the main area, with the presenter video in a smaller window (either picture-in-picture or other equivalent composition).  Use head/shoulder composition for the presentation rather than larger view areas.  Transitions from slides to speaker and back are acceptable when appropriate.

- **Background:** use a plain static background for the presenter, either the speaker’s normal office setting, a solid color, or a static virtual background if a green screen is available.  Do not use virtual backgrounds without a green screen, nor animated backgrounds due to the video artifacts that can be introduced.

- **Clothing:** plain clothing in solid color (no prints, logos, graphics etc.) tend to give better quality results.

- **Videos in slide shows:** do not include videos or fast-moving animations in the slide show material.  If video is required please send it separately and will be shown after the slide presentation.

- **Language/images:** please use care not to have any stereotypical or potentially offensive wording, images, or animations.  These will be flagged during review and videos will have to be redone.

- **Subtitles:** as the videos will be uploaded to the ACM YouTube Channel there is no need to worry about subtitles.

- **Video file name:** before uploading your video file, please name it using the following naming convention:

  **`{SID}-{presentation-order}-{presenter-last-name}.mp4`**

  where

  **`{SID}`** is your session ID (you can look for it in the program in the website)
  **`{presentation-order}`** is the order of your presentation in the session.
  **`{presenter-last-name}`** is the last name of the presenter.
  For instance, if you are the second (2) presenter in the third (3)
  session, the name of your file would be: 4-3-PresenterLastName.mp4.

- Slides: The presentation slides file should be in PDF format using a similar naming convention:

  **`{SID}-{presentation-order}-{presenter-last-name}.pdf`**

If you have any questions, please contact the TPC chairs.
